  <h1>The Manhole: New and extended</h1>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  Welcome to the world in and around The Manhole.
  Remember this is not a race, and you don't win or lose.
  The idea behind The Manhole is exploration.
  Take your time, look around, click on everything, and enjoy the journey.
  Every time you play, you'll probably find something new.
  To move around you simply click where you want to go.
  Clicking at the sides of the screen will sometimes turn you that direction.
  In some places you can look up or down as well.
  Even clicking a second time on a creature or object sometimes produces a different response!
  
  
(A classic game made by the creators of Myst and ported to Scratch by yours truly)

  Why have I reshared?
  Because it <strong>still</strong> isn't turning up in Scratch's broken
 search system.
  Try searching for "manhole". Maybe this time...

  The Manhole was first released by Cyan Worlds in 1988.
  In 1989 it was updated by Activision and was the first PC game ever to
 be released on CD.
  This is the "new and enhanced" version which was released in 1992.
  If you enjoy this you might want to consider purchasing the 
"masterpiece edition" which is available through Steam. 

  This is a port of the ScummVM's Made engine.
  It is capable of running several other wonderful games in addition to 
The Manhole and I may look into bringing those across at a later date.

  Note that I previously ported ScummVM's port of Beneath A Steel Sky 
but, due to issues with Scratch itself, was unable to include all the 
graphics required for the entire game.
  It's still worth a look though as it's a lot of fun!
